Patterns will not generate ready code for us
Patterns provide a template to follow

Creational Pattern
    - provide more flexibility in how objects are actually created

Structural Pattern
    - deal with how inheritance and composition can
      be used to provide extra functionality

Behavioral Pattern
    - are about communication and assignment
      of responsibilities between objects
